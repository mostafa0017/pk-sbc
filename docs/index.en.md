## P-KISS-SBC

P-KISS-SBC, is a __simple SIP Proxy__, easy to learn, fast to deploy, ready for production

## Why P-KISS-SBC ?

Numerous SIP / SBC Proxy or even SIP gateway solutions exist. 
Although the range may seem large, in reality there are 2 types of solution:

* __complete solutions__, but __complex__ to implement and operate. The entry ticket in terms of infrastructure (server and/or licence) is high. Finally, the day-to-day management skills (SIP peer creation, SIP debugging, etc.) require a good deal of training.
* __frameworks__, often OpenSource, such as Kamailio, OpenSIPS, Asterisk, FreeSwitch, Yate, etc., which allow you to develop your own in-house solution, but which require you to be familiar with the SIP/RTP protocols and these solutions.

## What is P-KISS-SBC ?

PKS is a __simple__, __high-performance__ and __modern__ SIP proxy for interconnecting SIP trunks and IPBXs.

Key features include :

* __Easy__: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time spent reading documentation.
* __Intuitive__: A clear, concise and useful web interface
* __Quick to deploy__: Configuration and deployment wizard.
* __High performance__: A single virtual machine can easily handle over a thousand simultaneous calls.
* __Robust__: Ready for production: stable, secure and reliable

P-KISS-SBC has been designed according to the __KISS__ principle, keep it simple, stupid! This principle defines a design guideline that advocates __simplicity__ and that any non-essential complexity should be avoided.

## What can I do with P-KISS-SBC ?

PKS is positioned as a simple solution with limited functionality. Its purpose is to meet the need to interconnect one or more operator SIP trunks to one or more IPBXs.
