# Do I need an SBC for my VoIP solution ?

The answer depends on the types of systems or equipment you need to connect and the level of security required by your organisation.

One of the main benefits of an SBC is that it can act as an application firewall, protecting your network from cyber-attacks.

An SBC can also secure your call flows, protecting against voice-specific attacks such as toll fraud, compliance breaches and corporate/state espionage.
