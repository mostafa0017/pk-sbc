# Geographical distribution of IPBX with centralised telecom operator connection

For reasons of flow optimisation, availability or load distribution, IPBX instances can be deployed on different sites. P-KISS-SBC enables a single connection to an operator and the calls to be routed simply to the desired instance: 

Call to site 1 : 

SIP PROVIDER ==== P-KISS-SBC ==== IPBX 1
                             ---- IPBX 2

Call to site 2 : 

SIP PROVIDER ==== P-KISS-SBC ---- IPBX 1
                             ==== IPBX 2
